# QRNG 

Scope: Simulation of a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) for both discrete-variable (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) systems. Generates long bitstrings suitable for applying randomness extraction models and allows comparison with real quantum-generated bitstrings from IBM Quantum processors.
